# E1: Hallbach Array
Question: How much does adding empty space between the strator magnets lessen the magnetic field?

Given:
- fixed air gap of 5mm
- 4x4x4 Neodym N42 (1.305 T) in halbach alignment on the stator
- long stator length

Targets:
- Magnetic field strength directly above air gap
- Direction of the magnetic field

Observations:
- 4mm spacing still has sinus like fields, a bit lower strength (-12%)
- Halbach start collapsing at 6mm spacing, -25% strength
- after 8mm (30% strength): no longer continiuous field (bumps on either side)

Result:
- Field strength changes approx. linearly with gap with ~0.083 T/mm
- at 6mm its no longer continuous

## Without Spacing
Max Flux: 0.25 T with alternating directions (approx. sinus with period of 16mm)

## With 6mm Spacing
Max Flux: 0.19 T with alternating directions (approx. sinus with period of 40 mm)
Lower maximum, no longer an approx. sinus curve.

## With 8mm Spacing
Max Flux: 0.18 T with alternating directions (approx. sinus with period of 48 mm).
Lower maximum and a "plain" before the "sinus" bump.
