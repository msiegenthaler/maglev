# Rail Guide Modelling
The stuff that keeps the train from falling off the rail or touching the rail.

## E9: Rail Guide Solenoid Placement
Question: Optimal placement of the solenoid to ensure that the car stays aligned betwenn to two rails.

see [Experiment 9](E9/E9_RailGuide.md)

Answer:
- S facing top, solenoid center 3mm below rail-magnet center is optimal (pulls towards rail)
- be careful if reversing the magnet, this is unstable. Probably better to try to only correct with S-top (on the side it is farter away)


## E10: Rail Guide Solenoid Shape
Question: What is the best shape of the solenoid to have maximum impact on the rail?

see [Experiment 10](E10/E10_Form.md)

Answer: Go as big as possible, because we will use less current that way and hopefully avoid the heating problem
