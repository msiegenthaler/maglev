Linear Motor Modelling
======================

## E1: Hallbach Array
Question: Does it make sense to use a hallbach array for the stator?

Answer: Yes, it's about twice as strong as the NS alignment with the same interval

see [Experiment 1](E1/E1_Hallbach.md)


## E2: Iron Sheet under Hallbach Array
Question: Does adding an iron sheet under the halbach array provide any benefit?

Answer: No, it does not make any difference at all

see [Experiment 2](E2/E2_IronSheet.md)
